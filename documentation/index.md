Thunderbird Project version numbers generally match up to Mozilla Firefox ESR
and beta versions. Thunderbird releases versions between ESRs
only as betas (for example 79-89 are betas only). Future ESR releases of
Thunderbird upcoming are (probably) 90, 102, etc. 

Thunderbird roughly tracks the ESR release schedule of Firefox. This means
that once a year in July or August, a new major release of Thunderbird is
ready, and every 4 weeks a new beta version.

# Release Drivers

The active team that is primarily responsible for Thunderbird releases is:

* Wayne Mery (:wsmwk, Release Manager)
* Rob Lemley (:rjl, Release Engineer)

The [Thunderbird drivers list](mailto:thunderbird-drivers@mozilla.org) consists
of the active team, those involved in producing Thunderbird releases, and
appropriate advisers. At the team's discretion, it also contains third parties
who are responsible for producing distributed builds of Thunderbird, primarily
Linux distributions, so that they are advised as to build and release progress,
timing and issues.
